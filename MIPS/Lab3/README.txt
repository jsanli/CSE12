Lab 3
This lab will introduce you to the MIPS ISA using MARS. You will write a program with several nested loops to print variable-sized ASCII diamonds and a sequence of embedded numbers.
In addition, this lab will introduce you to several different syscalls to incorporate I/O into your program.

Lab3.asm

Run Code by Launching Mars. Then open asm file in Mars. Run -> Assemble Execute -> Green Arrow Then follow instructions give to you by the program.
